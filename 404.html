                <p class="card-text">Dear Community,</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I want to inform you about an important decision regarding my independent projects. Due to concerns about protecting my creative works and ensuring their integrity, I have decided to temporarily unshare all my projects from public access.
                </p>
                <h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Reasons for This Decision</h3>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Protection of Intellectual Property:</strong> As a young creator, I am currently unable to fully protect my works through formal copyright registration. To prevent unauthorized use and copying, I have decided to take this precautionary step.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Maintaining Quality and Authenticity:</strong> I want to ensure that any future releases of my projects are of the highest quality and true to my vision. By unsharing my works, I can focus on refining and improving them without external interference.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Future Plans:</strong> I am working on a comprehensive plan to properly register and protect my works. Once I have the necessary legal protections in place, I will consider resharing my projects with the community.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">What This Means for You</h3>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Temporary Unavailability:</strong> My projects will be temporarily unavailable for public access. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> I will keep you informed about my progress and any updates regarding the availability of my projects. Please follow my official channels for the latest news.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Thank You for Your Support</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I am grateful for the support and enthusiasm of my community. Your encouragement motivates me to continue creating and sharing my stories. I look forward to bringing you even better content in the future.
